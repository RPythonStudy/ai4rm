               2) no involvement of main bronchus
               3) ly(+), n(-), v(-)
               4) no involvement of visceral pleura (P0)
               5) clear bronchial resection margin   
     (pathologic stage: pT2b)
   2. No specific non-neoplastic abnormal findings in the remaining lung

Lymph node, regional, dissection:
     Metastasis in six out of 26 lymph nodes <See NOTE-2>
     (peribronchial; 3/7, LN5; 1/10, LN6; 0/3, LN7; 1/1, LN9; 0/4, LN7(frozen); 1/1)
     (pathologic stage: pN2)

<NOTE>
1. 종양의 구성:
   * 본 환자의 종양은 하나의 종괴 내에 두 종류의 악성세포 성분이 공존하는 형태입니다.
      Mucin을 함유하는 adenocarcinoma(10%)와 poorly differentiated round cell sarcoma(90%)로
     구성되며, 두 성분 간의 경계가 지워지는 편입니다.
   * 면역염색 및 특수염색 결과,
       adenocarcinoma component : CK(+), CK7(+), CK20(-), TTF-1(+), CK5/6(focal), mucicarmin(+)
                                                        vimentin(-), desmin(-), ALK(+, weak)
       poorly differentiated round cell: CK(-), CK7(-), CK20(-), TTF-1(-), CK5/6(-), mucicarmin(-)
                                                           vimentin(+), desmin(-), ALK(+, weak)

2. 림프절 전이 양상: 
   * peribronchial lymph node metastasis(3/7)은 adenocarcinoma component의 전이이며,
   * regional lymph node metastasis (3/19)는 poorly differentiated round cell의 전이입니다.
