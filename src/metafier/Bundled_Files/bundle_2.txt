1. EGFR 유전자 변이는 약 25~50 %의 폐선암종에서 보인다. 주로 Exon 18 ~21에 걸쳐 잘 나타나며, 그 중 Exon19 유전자 Deletion 이 약 45 % 로 빈도수가 가장 높고, Exon21 nucleotide 2573의 point mutation (CTG>CGG, L858R)이 약 41%로 다발한다. 
이외 Exon 18, 20 의 유전자 변이가 알려져 있다. 
2. EGFR 유전자 변이의 형태에 따라  EGFR-targeted therapy에서 약제 감수성 또는 약제 저항성을 유발하는 것으로 보고되고 있다.

#1 Right upper lobe.  Received is a right upper  lobectomy specimen, measuring 16.3x12.0x5.6cm.  The pleura is diffusely pigmented by anthracotic pigmentation.  On section along the bronchus, there is a well demarcated tan gray stellate firm tumor, measuring 2.5x2.0cm.  The tumor is not related with bronchial mucosa and 3.0cm apart from bronchial resection margin.  The tumor is 1.5cm is apart from viseral pleura. Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear. Representative sections are embedded.

# Right upper lobe.  Received is a right upper lobectomy specimen, measuring 16x11x4cm.  On serial section, a 2.5x2.4x1.5cm-sized whitish tumor is identified.  It is 1cm and 1.5cm apart from the bronchial resection margin and visceral pleura.  The remaining parenchyma shows emphysematous change.  Representative sections are embedded.
