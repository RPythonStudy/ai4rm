#1: Left lower lobe. Received is a LLL lobectomy specimen, measuring 16x5x3cm. Pleural surface shows focal dimpling area. On section, there is a 1.9x1.0cm graysh white rubbery tumor at peripheral area. Adjacent visceral pleura is thickened and invasion is suspected. Remaining lung is unremarkable. Bronchial resection margin is 4cm apart from the tumor. Total tumor and representative sections are embedded. 
#2: Lymph node #5. Entirely embedded.
#3: Lymph node #7. Entirely embedded.
#4: Lymph node #9. Entirely embedded.
#5: Lymph node #10. Entirely embedded.
#6: Lymph node #12. Entirely embedded.
