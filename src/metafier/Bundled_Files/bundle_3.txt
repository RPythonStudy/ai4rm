#1 Left pneumonectomy.  Received is a left pneumonectomy specimen, meassuring 23x12x5cm and 426gm.  Subpleural parenchyma of left upper lobe shows a relatively well demarcated tannish gray solid tumor measuring 5.0x4.3x3.0cm.  It is very close to thickened parietal pleura with suspicious invasion.  The tumor is not directly connected with main bronchus.  The tumor is about 4cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Peribronchial lymph nodes are enlarged with tumor invasion. Bronchial resection margin is clear.

One is a relatively well circumscribed pale solid tumor with fuzzy margin, measuring 2.8x2.0x2.4cm. It is 4cm apart from bronchial resection margin and 0.5cm apart from pleural surface. Separate from the tumor, another well circumscribed cavitary lesion filled with dark green material, measuring 2.0x1.7x2.0cm. It shows thick capsule. Between the two lesion, poorly circumscribed pneumonic consolidation is noted. Two lesions are about 1cm apart from each other. Remaining lung parenchyma is unremarkable. Several peribronchial lymph nodes are enlarged. Representative sections are embedded.

【 Gross  】

#1: Right lower lobe. Received is a right lower lobe lobectomy specimen, measuring 11.5x11.0x9.0cm and weighing 299.5gm. On section, 8.7x7.0x5.5cm-sized ill defined, round, firm, gray to whitish tumor is noted. The tumor invades to visceral pleura. The tumor is 7cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear. Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. There is a 3.0x2.0cm-sized bulla. Bulla is 2.5cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Representative sections are embedded.

#2: Lymph node #7, #9, #11. Entirely embedded.

** Frozen section diagnosis **
1.  Bronchial resection margin ; No tumor involvement [설혜실]
       Received is a lump of fresh soft tissue, measuring 1.4x0.9cm.  Entirely embedded.

Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiatede
             with 1) size of invasion;  8.7x7.0x5.5cm
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent 
                    7) clear bronchial parenchymal resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT4]
     2. Pulmonary bulla

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in all 12 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/1, #7: 0/6, #9: 0/1, #11: 0/4)

PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura
