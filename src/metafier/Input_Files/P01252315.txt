#1: Left upper lobe.  Received specimen is left upper lobectomy specimen, measuring 17x12x4.0cm.  The pleura is diffusely pigmented by anthracotic pigment and there is a dimpling and in upper side.  On  section along the bronchus, a 3.9x3.8x3.5cm-sized well demarcated round satellite gray to whitish tumor is noted.  The tumor is related with bronchial mucosa and 1.0cm apart from bronchial resection margin.  The lung tissue around the tumor is consolidated.  Remaining parenchyma is grossly unrearkable.  Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear.  Representative sections are embedded.
