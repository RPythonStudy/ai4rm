# Right upper lobe.  Received is right upper lobe lobectomy specimen, measuring 16x10x5.0cm.  Attached fibrous adipose tissue in pleural side is noted and there is other linear incision.  Cross section along the bronchus, there is poorly  demarcated whitish mass lesion, measuring 5.0x2.0x2.0cm in peripheral side.  This mass does not related with bronchus. It is 5.0cm apart from bronchial resection margin.  This mass suspicious invaded into attached fibroadipose tissue. There is another calcified nodule, measuring 3.0x1.0cm.  Remaining parenchyma shows grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are embedded.
