#1: Right lung.  Received is a right upper lobectomy specimen, measuring 16.5x14.0x4.8cm, and 246.4gm.  The external suface of apical area shows raggedness and tumor exposure. Diffuse anthracotic pigmentation is noted on pleura.  On section along the bronchus, there is a well circumscribed tan gray firm tumor, measuring 4.4x1.8cm.  The tumor involves pleura.  Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear, 7.0cma apart from the tumor.  Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.  Representative sections are embedded.
<A: bronchial resection margin, B: peribronchial lymph node, C~E: tumor one plane, F,G: tumor, H: remaining>
#2: Right pleura.  Received is a flat soft tissue, measuring 4.3x3.0x0.8cm.  On serial section, it is tan gray fibrotic.  Representative section is embedded.
#3: Subcarinal lymph node.  Entirely embedded.
#4: Hilar lymph node.  Entirely embedded.
#5: Pulmonary ligament lymph node.  Entirely embedded.
#6: Interlobar lymph node.  Entirely embedded.
