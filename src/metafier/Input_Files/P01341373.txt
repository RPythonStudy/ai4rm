Lung, left lower lobe, wedge resection;
     Invasive adenocarcinoma, acinar predominant
         (acinar: 50%, micropapillary: 40%, lepidic: 10%), grade 3
             with 1) size of invasion; 1.3cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 1.4cm)
                    2) involvement of visceral pleura (PL1)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent 
                    7) clear parenchymal resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT2a]
  
PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
