#1: Right lower lobe. Received is a right lower lobe lobectomy specimen of lung, measuring 14x10.5x11.5cm. On section, there is a relatively well circumscribed pinkish gray solid tumor, measuring 5.7x3.2x2.3cm. Peripheral portion of the tumor is well circumscribed with lobulating margin and is close to visceral pleura. And proximal portion of the tumor is relatively less circumscribed and irregular along bronchial tree. The tumor is grossly 0.3cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Pleural invasion is not definite. Background lung shows localized consolidation at periphery. Representative sections are embedded.  <A; peribronchial lymph node, bronchial resection margin, B~G; tumor one plane, H,I; near bronchial margin, J; emphysema> 
#2: Lymph node #4, #7, #9, #11, #12. Entirely embedded.

   ** Frozen section diagnosis **
  Bronchial resection margin, right ; No tumor involvement [박선후]
       Received is a lump of fresh soft tissue, measuring 1.3x1.2cm. Entirely embedded.

Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated
           with 1) size of invasive tumor: 5.7x3.2x2.3cm
                    2) extension to peribronchial soft tissue
                    3) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    4) lymphatic invasion: present
                    5) vascular invasion: present
                    6) perineural invasion: absent 
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT3]
     2. Localized emphysema in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in nine out of 19 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 3/3, #4: 0/6, #7: 4/5, #9: 0/1, #11: 1/1, #12: 1/3)
     (with extranodal extension; peribronchial)
     [pathologic stage: pN2]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura
