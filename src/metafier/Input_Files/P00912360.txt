# Right lower lobe. Received is right lower lobe, measuring 15x10x5cm. There is a pleural dimpling at the lower lateral surface. Cut section reveals well demarcated, not encapsulated, partly infiltrative nodular lesion, measuring 5.5x3cm. It is 4.0cm apart from the bronchial resection margin. Enlarged metastatic lymph nodes are noted at the hilar portion. Remaining lung parenchyme is grossly clear. Representative sections are embedded.
# Lymph node #4, #7, #9, #11, #12, #13. Entirely embedded.

PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
