           with 1) size of invasion; 1.1x0.5cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 1.3x0.6x1.0cm)
                    2) no invasion beyond elastic layer of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) clear bronchial resection margin
