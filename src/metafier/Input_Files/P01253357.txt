#1: Right upper lobe.  Received is a right upper lobectomy specimen, measurng 13x12x4cm.  There is a tissue defect area due to frozen diagnosis.  On serial section, about 2.5x1.5cm-sized ill defined tumor is identified.  It is 1cm apart from the bronchial resection margin.  The remaining pulmonary parenchyme shows emphysematous change.  Representative sections are embedded.
