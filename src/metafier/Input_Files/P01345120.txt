# Right mid lobe.   Received is a right middle lobectomy specimen, measuring 15.5x12x4cm. On serial section, a 3x3x2.6cm sized well-demarcated round tumor is identified. It is 1.5cm apart from the bronchial resection margin and 0.3cm apart from the visceral pleura. Representative sections are embedded. 
<A: bronchial resection margin and peribronchial lymph nodes, B~E: tumor representative secion, F/G/H: tumor, I: remaining parenchyme>
# Lymph node #2, #7, #11. Entirely embedded.

Lung, right middle lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Carcinoid tumor (Typical carcinoid) 
             with 1) size of invasion; 3.0x3.0x2.6cm
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent
                    4) vascular invasion: present 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT1c]
     2. No abnormal findings in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in 13 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/2, #2: 0/6 , #7: 0/4, #11: 0/1)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
