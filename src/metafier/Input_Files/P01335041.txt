# Left upper lobe.  Received is a left upper lobectomy specimen of lung, measuring 22x15x6cm. On serial section, upper pole shows two separate lesions. One is a relatively well circumscribed pale solid tumor with fuzzy margin, measuring 2.8x2.0x2.4cm. It is 4cm apart from bronchial resection margin and 0.5cm apart from pleural surface. Separate from the tumor, another well circumscribed cavitary lesion filled with dark green material, measuring 2.0x1.7x2.0cm. It shows thick capsule. Between the two lesion, poorly circumscribed pneumonic consolidation is noted. Two lesions are about 1cm apart from each other. Remaining lung parenchyma is unremarkable. Several peribronchial lymph nodes are enlarged. Representative sections are embedded.

Lung, left upper lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, solid predominant
         (acinar: 40%, solid: 60%), grade 3
            with 1) size of invasion; 2.8x2.0x2.4cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 2.8x2.0x2.4cm)
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent
                    5) perineural invasion: absent
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): present
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT1c]
     2. Fungal ball, favor aspergilloma (non-invasive)
     3. Localized post-pneumonic fibrosis, between aspergilloma and cancer
     4. Peripheral emphysema

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in all (seven) lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/4, #lymph node; 0/3)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
