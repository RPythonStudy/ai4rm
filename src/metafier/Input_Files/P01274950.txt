# Right lower lobe. Received is a RLL lobectomy specimen, measuring 11x112x5cm. Pleural surface shows 5x5cm thickened fibrotic area. On section, there is a 5.5x5cm graysh white granular friable tumor at peripheral area. The tumor is in continuity with pleural lesion. Remaining lung shows pneumonic consolidation. Bronchial resection margin is 1.5cm apart from the tumor. Representative sections are embedded. 
# Parietal pleural. Received is a 4x4x1cm plate shape fibro-tumorous tissue. Representative sections are embedded. 
# Lymph node #2, #4, #7, #8, #10, #11, #12. Entirely embedded.

** Frozen section diagnosis **
1.  Right lower lobe resection margin ; No tumor involvement [설혜실]
       Received is a lump of fresh soft tissue, measuring 1.5cm.  Entirely embedded.

Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated
            with 1) size of invasion; 5.5x5cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 5.5cm)
                    2) involvement of parietal pleura and chest wall (PL3)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: present
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): present
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT3]
     2. Obstructive and organizing pneumonia in the background lung

Tissue labeled "palietal pleural", excision:
     Tumor positive involving whole thickness

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/2, #2: 0/11, #4: 0/12, #7: 0/8, #8: 0/2, #10: 0/2, #11: 0/3, #12: 0/5)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
