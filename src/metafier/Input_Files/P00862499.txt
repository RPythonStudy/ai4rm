【확인결과】

Lung, left upper lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, acinar predominant
         (acinar: 90%, lepidic: 10%), grade 2
             with 1) size of invasion; 3.1x1.5cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 3.1x2cm)
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0) (See NOTE)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent 
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT2a]
     2. No abnormal findings in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in 8 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/1, #7: 0/1, #9: 0/2, #10: 0/2, #11: 0/2)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]

<NOTE> 종양에 인접한 흉막이 이전 수술에 의한 유착 등으로 손상되어 있어 흉막 침윤여부를 정확하게 판단하기 어려우나,
평가가 가능한 부분에 한해서는 흉막 침윤이 관찰되지 않습니다. 


<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
