#1: Right middle lobe. Received is right middle lobe lobectomy lung, measuring 9x7x3cm. Probing along the main bronchial trees, all are patent. Cut section presents white, and infiltrative tan mass, measuring 2.5x2cm. It is 2.3cm apart from the bronchial resection margin. Pulmonary parenchyme resection margin is 1.5cm apart from the lesion. Pleura involvement is suspicious. Lesion is entirely embedded. <A: resection margin, B: pleura, C: pulmonary parenchymal resection margin, 
#2: Lymph node #2. Entirely embedded. 
#3: Lymph node #4. Entirely embedded.
#4: Lymph node #7. Entirely embedded.
#5: Lymph node #9. Entirely embedded.
#6: Lymph node #10. Entirely embedded.

Lung, right middle lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, acinar predominant 
         (acinar(cribriform):60%, papillary:30 %, micropapillary(filiform):5%, solid: %, lepidic:5%), grade 2
             with 1) size of invasion; 2.5x2cm
                    2) involvement of visceral pleura (PL1)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): present
                    7) clear bronchial parenchymal resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT1c]
     2. No abnormal findings in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     Metastatic carcinoma in three out of 19 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial;0/0, #2:0/2, #4:0/4, #7:3/7, #9:0/4, #10:0/2)
     [pathologic stage: pN2]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
