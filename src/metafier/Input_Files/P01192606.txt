#1 Right upper lobe.  Received is a right upper  lobectomy specimen, measuring 16.3x12.0x5.6cm.  The pleura is diffusely pigmented by anthracotic pigmentation.  On section along the bronchus, there is a well demarcated tan gray stellate firm tumor, measuring 2.5x2.0cm.  The tumor is not related with bronchial mucosa and 3.0cm apart from bronchial resection margin.  The tumor is 1.5cm is apart from viseral pleura. Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear. Representative sections are embedded. 
<A: bronchial resection margin, B: peribronchial lymph node, CD/EF: tumor, G: remaining>
#2 Lymph node 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 11(lower).
