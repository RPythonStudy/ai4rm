# Right lower lobe.  Received is a wedge resection specimen, measuring 7.4x5.0x3.8cm and 25.2gm.  It was previously bisected due to frozen diagnosis.  On serial section, there is a 1.6x1.2cm-sized ill circumscribed vaguely whitish lesion beside the tissue defect (probably for the frozen diagnosis).  Resection margin is grossly clear, 0.3cm apart from the lesion.  Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.  Representative section is embedded.
