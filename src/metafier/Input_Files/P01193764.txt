Subpleural parenchyma of left upper lobe shows a relatively well demarcated tannish gray solid tumor measuring 5.0x4.3x3.0cm.  It is very close to thickened parietal pleura with suspicious invasion.  The tumor is not directly connected with main bronchus.  The tumor is about 4cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Peribronchial lymph nodes are enlarged with tumor invasion. Bronchial resection margin is clear.
