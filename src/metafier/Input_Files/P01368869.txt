#7: Left lower lobe. Received is excised left lower lobe, measuring 16x7x4cm. It is previously transversely sectioned at the lower lateral part. The pleura is firm and fibrotic. Cut section reveals ill defined infiltrative granular, and gray lesion involving two third of specimen (measuring 12x3cm). Pleura involvement is not evaluable due to previous tissu fragmentation. Representative sections are embedded.
