#1 Left lung.  Received specimen is left pneumonectomy specimen, measuring 25x18x12cm. Outer surface shows grossly unremarkable.  Cross section reveals ill defined peri and endobroncial tumorous lesion in left lower lobe bronchus, measuring 2.0x1.0cm.  Distal part of left lower lobe bronchus shows consolidation in lung.  This area measures 4.0x3.0cm.  Bronchial resection margin shows grossly unremarkable. The tumorous lesion, it is 1.0cm apart from bronchial resection margin.  Representative sections are embedded.
