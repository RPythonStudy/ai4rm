#1: Left upper lobe. Received is a LUL lobectomy specimen, measuring 28x10x3cm. Apical pleural surface shows focal fibrotic area. On serial section, there is a 2.5x2.5cm grayish white glistening rubbery vaguely multinodular tumor at peripheral area. Adjacent visceral pleural invasion is suspected. Remaining lung shows focal yellow calcified lesion near the tumor and bullous change. Bronchial resection margin is 5.5cm apart from the tumor. Representative sections are embedded. 
#2: Lymph node #4, #5, #7, #12. Entirely embedded. 

** Frozen section diagnosis **
1.  Resection margin ; No tumor involvement [공준석]
       Received is a lump of fresh soft tissue, measuring 1cm.  Entirely embedded.
2.  Resection margin ; No tumor involvement [공준석]

Lung, left upper lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Small cell carcinoma
             with 1) size of invasion; 2.5x2.5cm
                    2) involvement of visceral pleura (PL1)
                    3) separate tumor nodules in same lobe
                    4) lymphatic invasion: present
                    5) vascular invasion: present
                    6) perineural invasion: absent 
                    7) spread through air space(STAS): present
                    8) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT3]
     2. 1) Dystrophic calcification with fibrosis, consistent with old Mycobacterial infection
         2) Bullae in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     Metastatic carcinoma in 2 out of 14 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 2/4, #4: 0/2, #5: 0/2, #7: 0/1, #12: 0/5)
     (with extranodal extension)
      [pathologic stage: pN1]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
