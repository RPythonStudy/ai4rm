#1: Right lower lobe. Received is a right lower lobe lobectomy specimen, measuring 11.5x11.0x9.0cm and weighing 299.5gm. On section, 8.7x7.0x5.5cm-sized ill defined, round, firm, gray to whitish tumor is noted. The tumor invades to visceral pleura. The tumor is 7cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear. Remaining parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. There is a 3.0x2.0cm-sized bulla. Bulla is 2.5cm apart from bronchial resection margin. Representative sections are embedded.

Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiatede
             with 1) size of invasion;  8.7x7.0x5.5cm
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent 
                    7) clear bronchial parenchymal resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT4]
     2. Pulmonary bulla

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in all 12 lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/1, #7: 0/6, #9: 0/1, #11: 0/4)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
