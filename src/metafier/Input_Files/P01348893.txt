# Left lower lobe. Received is a LLL lobectomy specimen, measuring 11x19x4cm. Pleural surface shows mild fibrotic appearance. On serial section, there is a well demarcated 2.6x2.4cm graysh white soft friable  tumor at peripheral area. Visceral pleural invasion is not suspected. Remaining lung is unremarkable. Bronchial resection margin is 4cm apart from the tumor. Representative sections are embedded. 
# Lymph node #4, #5, #7, #11. Entirely embedded.

** Frozen section diagnosis **
1.  LLL bronchial resection margin ; No tumor involvement [설혜실]
       Received is a lump of fresh soft tissue, measuring 1cm.  Entirely embedded.

Lung, left lower lobe, lobectomy:
     Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
             with 1) size of invasion; 2.6x2.4cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 2.6x2.4cm)
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): present
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT1c]

     2. Bullae, focal

Lymph node, dissection:
     Metastatic carcinoma in one out of lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/4, #4: 0/2, #5: 0/8, #7: 1/5, #11: 0/3)
     (with no extranodal extension)
     [pathologic stage: pN2]


PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
