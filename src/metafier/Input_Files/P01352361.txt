# Left lower lobe. Received is a lung left lower lobe lobectomy specimen, measuring 14x11x5cm. On serial section, about 2.1x1.2x1.5cm-sized whitish tumor is identified. It is very close to visceral pleura and 2cm apart from the bronchial resection margin. Representative sections are embedded.

# Lymph node #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #11, #12. Entirely embedded.

** Frozen section diagnosis **

Lung, left lower lobe, lobectomy:
     1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, papillary predominant
         (acinar: 20%, papillary: 60%, lepidic: 20%), grade 2
             with 1) size of invasion; 1.8x1.2cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 2x1.2cm)
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent 
                    4) vascular invasion: absent 
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent 
                    7) clear bronchial resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pT1b]
     2. No abnormal findings in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in 16 lymph nodes
     (#4: 0/2, #5: 0/5, #6: 0/2, #7: 0/3, #9: 0/1, #11: 0/2, #12: 0/1)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]


<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
