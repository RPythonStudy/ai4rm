Lung, right lower lobe, thoracoscopic wedge resection of the RLL posterior basal segment:
     1. Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, nonmucinous
             with 1) size of invasion; 0.3cm
                       (total extent including lepidic pattern: 1.0cm)
                    2) no involvement of visceral pleura (PL0)
                    3) lymphatic invasion: absent
                    4) vascular invasion: absent
                    5) perineural invasion: absent 
                    6) spread through air space(STAS): absent
                    7) clear parenchymal resection margin
        [pathologic stage: pTmi]
     2. No abnormal findings in the background lung

Lymph node, dissection:
     No metastasis in lymph nodes
     (peribronchial; 0/0, #4: 0/3, #7: 0/2, #11: 0/2)
     [pathologic stage: pN0]

PL0
PL1; Tumor invades beyond the elastic layer 
PL2; Tumor invade to the pleural surface 
PL3; Tumor invade into any component of the parietal pleura

<Proposed grading of resected early-stage invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma>
Grade 1: Lepidic-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 2: Acinar or papillary-predominant with no or <20% high-grade pattern
Grade 3: Any tumor with ≥20% high-grade pattern (solid, micropapillary, cribriform, or complex glandular pattern)
