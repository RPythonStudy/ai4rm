# Left lung.  Received is a left upper lobectomy specimen, measuring 18x9.5x5.5cm and weighing 540gm. Grayish fimr tumor is exposed at bronchial resection margin.  The lung is previously perforated at supero-posterior side.  Perforation site measures 3.8x2cm.  Outer surface is covered with necrotic materials.  There is a second perforation site at antero-lateral portion, measuring 3x0.8cm.  On section along the bronchus, a 4.2x2.5x3cm-sized relatively well circumscribed grayish white firm and polygonal tumor is noted at peribronchial portion.  It is very close (0.4cm) to bronchial resection margin.  A hematoma, measuring 4x2.5cm is noted at visceral side of the tumor.  The bronchiole is filled with mucoid materials.  Representative sections are embedded.

#1 Presacral lesion mass.  Received is an excised soft tissue, measuring 3x2.8x2.7cm.  A 2x1.5cm-sized peritoneum is attached.  On section, it is totally replaced by tan and partly hemorrhagic fish fleshy round tumor.  It is marginally resected.   Representative sections are embedded.
