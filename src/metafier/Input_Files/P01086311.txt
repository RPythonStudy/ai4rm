# Left lower lobe.  Received is a left lower lobectomy specimen, measuring 15x9x9cm. On section, a relatively well circumscribed whitish tan granular solid tumor, measuring 4.5x4.0cm, is noted.  It extends to main bronchus and peribronchial lymph nodes.  Bronchial resection margin is grossly clear but very close to tumor (safety margin; 0.1cm).  The distal bronchioles are dilated and contains mucus. Remaining parenchyma is consolidated.  Representative sections are embedded.
